## 🎯 The Project: Problem & Solution

### Problem
USF students lack **proactive self-awareness** to recognize early stress signals and struggle to schedule preventative breaks.

### Solution
**MellowDown** is a single-page web app that provides **proactive intervention** against burnout through two core features:

1.  **Burnout Risk Score:** A weighted algorithm calculates a personalized score (0-10) based on Mood, Stress, Sleep, and Study input.
2.  **Campus Calm Map:** If the risk score is **7.0 or higher**, the app issues a **Mandatory Break Alert** and guides the user to the nearest quiet zone on the USF campus, including estimated walking times.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Implementation

This is a **Client-Side Web Application** (runs entirely in the browser).

* **HTML5:** Structured the user interface, including the Check-in form, Mood History Chart placeholder, and the Campus Calm Map.
* **CSS3 (`style.css`):** Implements **USF branding** (green and gold), responsive layout, and visual display of the mood history tiles.
* **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Contains the **core logic** for the weighted **Burnout Risk Score calculation**, page routing, and dynamic map marker/distance rendering.
